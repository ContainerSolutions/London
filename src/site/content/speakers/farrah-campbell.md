title: "Empowering Careers with Serverless"
description: "Serverless is a lot more than Lambda or Knative. Serverless is a mindset and increasingly, an approach to strategic innovation for enterprises. The technical aspects of serverless are important but above all, this sector of technology is a paradigm shift in engineering.

In this talk, Farrah Campbell, Ecosystem Director at Stackery and AWS Serverless Hero, will share how adopting a “Serverless Mindset” empowers teams and people to overcome exciting technical challenges and superpower innovation. She’ll share real-world serverless stories like building Cloudformation 60x faster, how to migrate to cloud native with serverless, and how she open-sourced her first serverless project to serve the serverless community itself.

Attendees will be encouraged to get out of the negative and limiting outlook that a particular technology is “hard” or “complex” and instead focus on the values and end goals with serverless as a case study. Furthermore, the audience will walk away feeling galvanized to try something new."
