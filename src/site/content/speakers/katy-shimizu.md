title: "Infinite Scaling, Finite Failures: Serverless Resiliency Patterns"
description: "You’ve built a beautiful workflow from serverless components. Your costs are down, your productivity is up, you’re scaling smoothly and life is good! ..now something is down, events keep coming in, and failures are cascading through your system. How do you recover from this? Can you?

The distributed nature of most serverless architectures makes resiliency, consistency and state management key design considerations. In this talk, we’ll discuss strategies to minimize the impact of platform and application failures and examine Azure’s Durable Functions as an example approach for creating resilient, stateful serverless processes and workflows."

Part of the team that develops Functions, an event-driven serverless compute platform, she has been primarily involved with the Durable Functions extension, which bring complex stateful orchestration capability to the stateless platform."
