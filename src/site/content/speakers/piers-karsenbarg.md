title: "Make smartphone-only banks more accessible"
description: "The challenger banks are here! But not if you don't own a smartphone, like my 73 year old dad. I managed to sell him on the benefits of one of them, but without a smartphone there's no way he can check his balance or get notifications when payments are made.

In this talk I'll be showing how I used Twilio (and a little bit of serverless magic) can be used to make challenger banks more accessible to people (like my dad) who make the choice not to use smartphones."
