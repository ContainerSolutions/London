title: "A Look at Events with EventBridge"
description: "Serverless magic comes from events. Most people believe that functions are the key but really it is the events that are emitted by any software systems and rendered actionable that make all of it magical. AWS EventBridge is set to become a critical component of any serverless application in AWS, it is an event proxy that helps defines event to function/service mapping. In this talk we will give an intro to EventBridge and show its real power."

bio: "Sebastien has been in open-source for a while. He was flabergasted by the meteoric rise of Docker, ended up falling in love with Kubernetes very early. He created kubeless one of the first FaaS platform on Kubernetes. Recently he founded TriggerMesh to build the first serverless integration Platform and put his focus back on building applications. "
