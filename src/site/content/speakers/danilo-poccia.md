title: Observability for serverless apps - What should you look at?
description: "How deeply can you understand what is happening inside your application, from a technical and business point of view? Serverless apps use a distributed architecture. It's critical to have end-to-end observability of each component and the communications between them in order to quickly identify and debug issues. In this session, we show how to have the necessary instrumentation and how to use the data you collect to have a better grasp of your production environment. We'll see how to collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of resources, applications, and services. In this way, you'll be able to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors with an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application. Examples are based on AWS."
