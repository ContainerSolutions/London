title: A pizza ordering bot in 20 minutes, live on stage. Pizza not included! 
description: |
  In this session, I'll build a pizza ordering bot with Azure Bot Services in 30 minutes, live on stage. No pressure, challenge accepted! 
  
  We will see what makes a conversational bot a *great bot*, how to connect to channels for an improved conversation experience, meet existing bots and enable them to interpret and interact in a human way. And we will enhance the user experience with actions like greeting customers after they start chatting, or providing a personalised menu. Our aim is to get the bot deliver our favourite pizza by thinking that we are interacting with an actual human being. 
  
  Pizza not included, sorry!
