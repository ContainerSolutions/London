title: Does it matter? High Availability, and Disaster Recovery in Serverless solutions.
description: |
  When we talk to customers about "Serverless architectures" the topic of High Availability and Disaster Recovery comes up, the perception usually is that in a Serverless world we don't care about these because, well; we are Serverless! 
  The flip side of the coin is different. In this talk, I will discuss the design and planning considerations for building robust serverless solutions using Microsoft Azure services example.
