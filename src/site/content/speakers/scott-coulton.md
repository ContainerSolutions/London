title: Understanding opensource FaaS 
description: "In this talk, I will walk through why a business might choose to run there on FaaS solution. A perfect example of this might be for multi-cloud failover,  for security controls over the environment in a regulated environment and lastly might run their own servers but want the freedom of FaaS.  Another reason that a business might choose to run their own FaaS is that the language that they use is not supported by the clouds. We will then compare features in both OpenFaaS and Knative to see how they compare but so the audience can walk away armed with the knowledge to make an informed decision. We will then look at how each solutions portability stacks up. Lastly, we will take look that the security controls each platform has as that will be a key factor in running your own FaaS."
