title: "Serverless with Google Cloud and Firebase"
description: >
  Come learn what serverless means for Google Cloud and Firebase, and how we're building tools beyond Functions-as-a-Service to help you create powerful serverless applications. With live coding and live demos, Bret will cover Google Cloud Functions and Firebase, Google's serverless backend for mobile and web developers. Firebase can help you add powerful features to your applications, with everything from real time data updates, user authentication, monetizing your apps, and more. Learn how to leverage the power of Google to quickly build autoscaling apps - all without managing servers or application runtimes.
