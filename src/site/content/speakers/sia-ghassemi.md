title: "Unleash the full power of Excel Spreadsheets with Azure Serverless"
description: "Thanks to the new Custom Functions for Excel, you can now connect your Spreadsheet to Azure. Where as fetching data from Azure Datastores in spreadsheets is a everyday feature, Custom Functions gives developers the power to move business logic out of a spreadsheet and into Azure to enable the best experience for Users. Use Azure Functions to host your business logic and Excel-formulas donâ€™t have to change, when the algorithm changes. Use Azure SignalR Service to update a cell frequently, without any interaction.

In this session you see how you can use Excel and Azure Serverless to bring the best Experience to Users."
